\section{Overview}
For problems in iDASH Secure Genome Analysis Competition~\footnote{\url{http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2015/}}, we implemented them using the secure computation framework {\sf ObliVM}~\footnote{\url{http://www.oblivm.com}}~\cite{oblivm}.
For each question, we provide multiple solutions, with manually built circuits and automatically built circuits:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Task1a: we provide two solutions, one built manually, one built using compiler. Both of them achieve exact result with no error.
\item Task1b: we provide three solutions, two built manually, one built using compiler. The second manually built circuit can achieve a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.
\item Task2a/b: we provide four solutions, one built manually using oblivious merge, one built with compiler using oblivious merge, one built manually using bloom filter, and one built using compiler. The one with bloom filter can be tuned for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.
\end{enumerate}

All the implementations will be open sourced at \url{https://github.com/wangxiao1254/idash_competition} after the deadline of the competition.

\section*{Supplemental Information}
\section{{\sf ObliVM} Overview}

{\sf ObliVM} is a programming framework for secure computation, offering the 
following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\bf Ease-of-use.} Non-specialist programmers can easily 
write programs in our source language {\sf ObliVM-lang}, a 
familiar imperative-style language.
\item
{\bf Efficiency.} {\sf ObliVM} compiles these programs into 
concise circuit representations suitable for secure computation. 
Much as MapReduce is a programming paradigm for 
parallel computation, {\sf ObliVM} offers user- and compiler- friendly
programming abstractions for secure computation.
\item
{\bf Formal security.}
{\sf ObliVM} offers a security type system to ensure 
that programs supplied by nonspecialist developers
will be executed securely without leaking information.
At a high level, the security type system guarantees
that a program's execution traces 
is oblivious to secret inputs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Capabilities of {\sf ObliVM}.} 
{\sf ObliVM} supports richer and much more sophisticated applications
than the challenges given in this competition.
We have developed a variety of demo applications in machine learning,
streaming algorithms, graph algorithms, 
common data structures, and common utilities.
Using {\sf ObliVM}, we have demonstrated queries on {\sf GB} 
databases where we can compute the answers in a reasonable amount of time.

\section{Thank You and Suggestions to the Organizers}
We think this competition is such a fantastic idea. 
It definitely helps to bridge communities, and helps 
state-of-the-art secure computation technology  
find its way in high-impact application domains.
We are grateful to the organizers for organizing this competition,
and for detailed discussions and feedback 
throughout.

We really hope that more competitions like this will be held in the future.
If a competition like this is to be repeated, we strongly 
suggest that the organizers increase the difficulty 
of the challenges --- e.g., consider much more sophisticated tasks
and bigger data sizes. 
We feel that the simple and small-scale nature of the problems  
in this competition is insufficient to fully demonstrate the true power
of state-of-the-art secure computation frameworks such as {\sf ObliVM}.
