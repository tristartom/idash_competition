\section{Task1}
\subsection{Task1a, Computing Minor Allele Frequencies}
The problem of computing Minor Allele Frequencies(MAF) can be abstracted as follows:

Suppose Alice and Bob each has a list of alleles $l^a = (e^a_1,...,e^a_n)$ and $l^b = (e^b_1,...,e^b_n)$.
Let's append $l^b$ to $l^a$ and get $l = l^a || l^b$. It is known that in $l$, there will be at most two types of
alleles from $(A,T,C,G)$. We want to compute the frequency of allele in $l$ what appears less frequent.

\paragraph{Our Solution}
The two parties first aggregate their own input into two numbers $(f^a_1, f^a_2)$ for Alice and $(f^b_1,f^b_2)$ for Bob, ordered by allele type.
Then, in the secure computation, the two parties first aggregate the frequency by
$$(f_1, f_2) = (f^a_1+f^a_1, f^b_2+f^b_2),$$
and then report the smaller number between $f_1$ and $f_2$

For this task, each test case only requires 40 AND gates for both manually generated circuits and automatically generated circuits.

\subsection{Task1b, Computing $\chi$ square statistics}
The problem can be abstracted as follows:
The two parties want to compute the following results:
$$n\times\frac{(ad-bc)^2}{rsgk},$$
where $r = a + b, s = c + d, g = a + c, k = b + d, n =  r + s$; and $a,b,c,d$ are additively secret shared by two parties.

\paragraph{Our Solution}
In the high level, our solution folows the directly approach: in secure computation, we first add shares from two parties and get $a,b,c,d$
and then convert it into floating point numbers securely, and finally compute the function mentioned above directly.

For this task, each test case only requires 7763 AND gates achieving maximum absolute error of $1.11\times0^{-4}$
and 14443 AND gates achieving maximum absolute error of $5.6\times0^{-8}$.
