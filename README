Step 1: Config.conf and replace localhost to the other party's IP
Step 2: run the following command on both machine, one with [party]=gen, one with [party]=eva on same tasks:

python run.py [party] [tasks] [more options]

where 
[party] can be gen or eva
[tasks] can be task1a, task1b, task2astd, task2abf, task2bstd, task2bbf
[more options] is used to specify datafiles and more.


Detail:
task1a: Computing MAF. 
      [more options]: -c casefile -t controlfile [ -a ]
      -c and -t are used to specify case and control file, -a is used to specify if we will run the circuit constructed manually or generated automatically by compiler With -a, it will use automatically generated circuit.

task1b: Computing Chi Square.
      [more options]: -c casefile -t controlfile [ -a | -h ]
      meaning is similar to the above
      when -a is not used, -h can be used to have higher precision.

task2astd: Computing Hamming Distance Standard
      [more options]: -f data [-a]
      -f is used to specify the input file, -a is used similarly as before

task2abf: Computing Hamming Distance BloomFilter
      [more options]: -f file -p NUMBER
      -f is used to specify the input file, -p is used to specify approximation quality followed with an integer from 10 to 120. Default value is 20 is no value is provide. the larger the NUMBER used, the better.

task2bstd: Computing Edit Distance Standard
      [more options]: -f data [-a]
      -f is used to specify the input file, -a is used similarly as before

task2bbf: Computing Edit Distance BloomFilter
      [more options]: -f file -p NUMBER
      -f is used to specify the input file, -p is used to specify approximation quality followed with an integer from 10 to 120. Default value is 20 is no value is provide. the larger the NUMBER used, the better.
